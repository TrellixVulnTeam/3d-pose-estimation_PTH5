# 3D Pose Estimation for Voleyball Performance Testing

## Project Structure

1. 2D Pose Estimation

We use PyraNet 2D pose estimator to get all joints for sports.

2. 3D Pose Estimation

We use VideoPose3D for 3D pose estimation in the wild based on 2D pose estimation.

3. Multicam 3D Pose Estimation

With a simple algorithm we join together results from different views from the 3D pose estimation.
